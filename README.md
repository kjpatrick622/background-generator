# background-generator
simple left-to-right gradient background generator with css code readout

In this project I was beginning to learn how to use the DOM to access different elements and change them dynamically on a webpage. The HTML and CSS are very 
simple but the Javascript was fun/challenging part to learn. I had to use the dom and update my understanding on how websites load to have the initial bakcground
colors of the webpage be the values of the color inputs on first page load. Query Selector came in handy. I had to create a function that would print out the CSS
for the background after the two color inputs have been updated. This was a callback function passed through an event listener that's listening for a click on the 
input. 

The fun part about this mini projcet was creating the random button and having it assing two random hexadecimal codes to the color inputs and apply that style
to the background when clicked. 

A surprising amount of research and time went into making this but I learned a lot the way!
